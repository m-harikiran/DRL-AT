## About

Over the last twenty years, stock markets have changed significantly, from face-to-face interactions in the stock exchange to the remote digital world. The transition to the digital world has changed the fate of investment companies and individuals investing in the stock market. Traditionally, investment companies calculate the expected returns of the stocks and then maximize their returns by selecting the best portfolio allocation for a given risk. With the introduction of digital exchanges and the availability of computing power, investment companies started developing trading algorithms that could buy and sell stocks in a completely automated way, and it is estimated that around 70-80 percent of the trading done through computer algorithms in the USA. However, all these algorithms use traditional strategies like mean-reversion, trend-following, and breakout, which cannot predict the market crash. 

This project aims to build the trading process as a Markov Decision Process and take advantage of reinforcement learning algorithms to maximize the portfolio returns by finding the best trading strategy in the complex and dynamic stock market.
